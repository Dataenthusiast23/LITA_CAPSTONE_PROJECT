### Project Overview
---
This project involves analysing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. The goal is to
understand customer behaviour, track subscription types and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals

### Data Source
---
The primary source of the Data used here is Customer Data.xlsx. which I received from my school 
LMS which I downloaded into my System for the analysis. The dataset include the following columns:

1. CustomerID: The identity of each customer
2. CustomerName: Name of each customer
3. Region: Geographical location of Subcribers
4. Subscription Type: Subscription packages
5. Subscription Start: Begining of Subscription
6. Subscription End: Termination of Subscription
7. Cancelled: Active & Cancelled subcribers
8. Revenue: Amount generated by Service Provider.  

### Project Objectives

This project was designed to analyze and report with an interactive POWER BI dashboard the following findings:

  -Customer by subscription type: This aim at knowing the number of subscriber and the type of package they belong
 
  -Total Reveue: this represent the total sales made by the servive provider within the year included in the dataset  
               
  -Total number of cancelled subscription: this seeks to calculate the number of cancellations by subscribers.

  ### Tools and Methods Used
   ---
- Microsoft Power BI [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
    
  -Data Analysis: This was achieved using power query editor for cleaning, removing duplicate, adding new columns, changed text type
      for easy interpretation. 
     
  -Data Visualisation: Visuals created in the report view  to visually represent the Key insights. 
    
  -GitHub for Portfolio Building

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA Involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the Data such as;

  - Calculation of subscription duration
  - Number of subscriber from each region.
  - Which category has the highest revenue?
  - What is the top Subscription type?
